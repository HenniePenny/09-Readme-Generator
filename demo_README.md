  ## Description
  
  This is a command-line application which dynamically generates a "demo_README.md". The app has been created using Node.js and the inquirer and chalk package.
  
  ## Installation
  
  First you need to install the needed packages by running the command ``npm install`` in your terminal. Afterwards, initiate the app by typing ``node index.js``.
  
  ## Usage
  
  After initiating the app, you will be prompted with a series of questions: give your answer or make a choice accordingly. A README file will be created containing all the sections from the questions. If you choose no license, the whole section will be omitted from the created readme file. Use the app anytime you would like to create a new readme file.
